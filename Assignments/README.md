# Assignments for the Course COL106

1. Using a stack to locate the position of a Drone
2. Simulation of Many-Particle Collisions (September,2022):
    - Simulated the collisions of n particles moving randomly in a one-dimensional universe
    - Used heap data structure to determine the locations and times of frst m collisions
3. Searching for Restaurants:
    - Preprocessed the locations of n restaurants to make a 2D range tree
    - This facilitates efcient restaurant search in O(m+(logn)^2) time (where m is the number of restaurants in the given range)
4. Randomized Pattern Matching:
    - Developed a randomized algorithm for improving the complexity of Rabin Karp Algorithm
5. Maximum Capacity Route:
    - Found an algorithm for determining the path with maximum capacity in a computer network consisting of n routers communicating information to one another
